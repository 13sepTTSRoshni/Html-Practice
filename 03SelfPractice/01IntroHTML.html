                <h1>What is HTML</h1>
                <br>
                <li class="bg-success p-2">HTML is an acronym which stands for <b>Hyper Text Markup
                        Language</b> which is used for creating web pages
                    and web
                    applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="bg-success p-2"><b>Hyper Text:</b> HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A
                    text has a link within it, is a hypertext.
                    Whenever
                    you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is
                    a way
                    to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="bg-success p-2"><b>Markup language:</b> A markup language is a computer language
                    that is used to apply layout and formatting
                    conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn
                    text
                    into images, tables, links, etc.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="bg-success p-2"><b>Web Page: </b> A web page is a document which is commonly
                    written in HTML and translated by a web
                    browser. A web
                    page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. <b>With
                        the help
                        of
                        HTML only, we can create static web pages</b> </li>
                <br>
                <li class="bg-success p-2">Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating
                    attractive web pages with the help of styling,
                    and which looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and
                    each HTML
                    tag contains different content.</li>

                <li class="bg-success p-2"><b>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; :</b> It defines the document type or it instruct the
                    browser about the version

                <li class="bg-success p-2"><b>&lt;html&gt; :</b> This tag informs the browser that it is an HTML
                    document. Text between html
                    tag

        <h1>Brief History of HTML</h1>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2">In the late 1980's , a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor at CERN,
            proposed a system for CERN
            researchers. In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2"><b>Tim Berners-Lee </b> is known as the father of HTML. The first available
            description of HTML was a
            document
            called "HTML Tags" proposed by Tim in late 1991. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which we will learn
            later in this tutorial.</li>
        <br><br>

        <h1>HTML Versions</h1>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2">Since the time HTML was invented there are lots of HTML versions in market, the brief
            introduction about the
            HTML version is given below:</li>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2"><b>HTML 1.0 :</b> The first version of HTML was 1.0, which was the barebones version
            of HTML language, and
            it
            was released in1991.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2"><b>HTML 2.0 :</b> This was the next version which was released in 1995, and it was
            standard language version
            for website design. HTML 2.0 was able to support extra features such as form-based file upload, form
            elements such as text box, option button, etc.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2"><b>HTML 3.2 :</b> HTML 3.2 version was published by W3C in early 1997. This version
            was capable of creating
            tables
            and providing support for extra options for form elements. It can also support a web page with complex
            mathematical equations. It became an official standard for any browser till January 1997. Today it is
            practically supported by most of the browsers.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2"><b>HTML 4.01 :</b> HTML 4.01 version was released on December 1999, and it is a very
            stable version of HTML
            language. This version is the current official standard, and it provides added support for stylesheets (CSS)
            and scripting ability for various multimedia elements.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2"><b>HTML5 : </b> HTML5 is the newest version of HyperText Markup language. The first
            draft of this version
            was
            announced in January 2008. There are two major organizations one is W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), and
            another one is WHATWG( Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) which are involved in the
            development of HTML 5 version, and still, it is under development.</li>
        <br><br>


        <h1> Features of HTML</h1>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2">It is a very easy and simple language. It can be easily understood and modified.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2"> It is very easy to make an effective presentation with HTML because it has a lot of
            formatting tags.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2"> It is a markup language, so it provides a flexible way to design web pages along
            with the text.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2">It facilitates programmers to add a link on the web pages (by html anchor tag), so it
            enhances the interest
            of browsing of the user.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2">It is platform-independent because it can be displayed on any platform like Windows,
            Linux, and Macintosh,
            etc.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2">It facilitates the programmer to add Graphics, Videos, and Sound to the web pages
            which makes it more
            attractive and interactive.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="bg-success p-2">HTML is a case-insensitive language, which means we can use tags either in lower-case
            or upper-case.
        </li>
